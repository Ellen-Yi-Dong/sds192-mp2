## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!  

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}
## Filtering and Grouping the Contributions and House Elections Tables
ca_house_elections <- house_elections %>%
  filter(state == "CA" & transaction_amt > 0) %>%
  select(state, transaction_amt, cand_id) %>%
  mutate(cand_id = fec_id)

ca_contributions <- contributions %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  filter(transaction_amt > 0) %>%
  select(state, transaction_amt, cand_id) %>%
  mutate(fec_id = cand_id) %>%
  filter(!is.na(fec_id))
```

```{r} 
## Joining the Contributions and House Elections Tables
contributions_helections <- ca_house_elections %>% 
 full_join(ca_contributions, by = "fec_id")

#Filtering out the NA in the joined table 
contributions_helections %>%
  filter(!is.na(state.y)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(transaction_amt)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(cand_id)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(incumbent))
```

```{r}
#Trying to separate incumbent by TRUE and FALSE
ggplot(g_contributions_helections, aes(x = district.x, y = mean_votes)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = incumbent.x)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("FALSE" = "black", "TRUE" = "red")) + 
  labs(color = "Incumbent Status", 
         x = "District", 
         y = "Mean Number of Primary Votes", 
         title = "The Mean Number of Primary Votes for Each Politician in a Certain District in CA", 
         subtitle = "With Respect to Incumbency"
         )
```
