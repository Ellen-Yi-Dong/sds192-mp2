## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}
ca_house_elections <- house_elections %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  group_by(primary_votes)

ca_contributions <- contributions %>%
  filter(state == "CA") %>%
  group_by(transaction_amt)
```
